            <aside><p>The creator of the Versace fashion house is Giovanni Versace, also known as just Gianni Versace. Gianni was born in Southern Italy, in the city of Reggio Calabria in 1946. He grew up with his elder brother Santo Versace and his younger sister Donatella Versace. His mother had a sewing business and that was where Gianni took his first apprenticeship at a young age.
He was interested in fashion, design, and architecture and at the age of 26, he moved to Milan and started his career in fashion design. There he worked for several Italian ateliers such as Mario Valentino, Complice and Genny. His talent showed early on and soon he established his own company. In 1978 he presented his first signature collection for women's clothing and opened his boutique in Milan. Ever since then his brother Santo and his sister Donatella have been working for him.
Versace's fashion shows kept getting more and more successful and by the 90s, he had already built an amazing fashion empire. His designs were bold, innovative and very different from the ones his competitors presented. Gianni was not afraid to use bright colors and sexy cuts but still managed to keep his clothing classy and luxurious. Many thought he was a genius but his bold taste had to endure a lot of criticism as well. His rivalry with the famous Giorgio Armani was no secret. Their collections were so different that soon the saying that Armani dresses the wife, Versace dresses the mistress‚Äù became popular.</p></aside>
